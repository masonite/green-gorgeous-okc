## **Email 1: ATTENTION + CURIOSITY HOOK**
**Send:** Day 1
**Subject:** Quick question about [Business Name]'s online presence

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I help lawn care businesses get more customers through professional websites.

Quick question: Are you getting as many leads from your online presence as you'd like?

Most contractors I talk to are missing 3-5 jobs every month because:
• Customers can't find them online
• Their contact info isn't easy to find  
• They don't look as professional as competitors with websites

**Simple yes/no:** Would you like to see what a professional website could do for your business?

No pressure - just a quick look at what's possible.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Website Factory

**P.S.** I've helped 12 other lawn care businesses in [City] get websites that actually generate leads. Happy to show you examples if you're curious.

**Psychology Used:**
- **Curiosity gap** - "what's possible"
- **Social proof** - "12 other businesses"
- **Low-pressure CTA** - "just a quick look"
- **Reciprocity** - Offering value first

## **Email 2: PAIN AMPLIFICATION + AGITATION**
**Send:** Day 3 (if no reply)
**Subject:** The hidden cost every month [Business Name] doesn't have a website

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Following up on my question about your online presence.

Here's what most contractors don't realize:

**Every month without a professional website costs you:**
1. **3-5 missed jobs** ($150-500 in lost revenue)
2. **Reduced credibility** - Customers choose competitors who look more professional
3. **Phone tag frustration** - Customers can't easily book or get quotes online
4. **Google invisibility** - 85% of customers search online first

**The math is simple:**
• Average lawn care job: $75
• 4 missed jobs/month: $300
• Annual cost: **$3,600 in lost revenue**

That's more than 7x what a professional website costs.

**Question:** How much business do you think you're leaving on the table?

No need to reply if you're not interested - I'll stop following up.

But if you want to fix this, reply with "SHOW ME" and I'll send you a mockup of what [Business Name] could look like with a professional website.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

**P.S.** This isn't about selling you something. It's about showing you what you're missing so you can decide if it's worth fixing.

**Psychology Used:**
- **Loss aversion** - Highlighting what they're losing
- **Specific numbers** - $3,600 makes it real
- **Contrast principle** - Compare loss to solution cost
- **Takeaway close** - "I'll stop following up" creates urgency

## **Email 3: DESIRE CREATION + FUTURE PACING**
**Send:** Day 5 (if opened Email 2 but no reply)
**Subject:** Imagine this for [Business Name]...

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Let me paint a picture of what could be different for [Business Name]:

**Imagine...**
• Waking up to 2-3 new lead notifications every morning
• Customers finding you easily, trusting you immediately, booking online
• Looking as professional as the big companies (but paying a fraction)
• No more phone tag - quotes and bookings happen automatically
• Your phone ringing with pre-qualified customers ready to hire

**That's what happens when you have a professional website.**

Mike from Mike's Lawn Care felt the same way you might be feeling - frustrated with missed opportunities. Then he got a website.

**30 days later:**
• 12 new jobs booked through his website
• $900 in new revenue
• "Best $500 I ever spent on my business"

**Visualize this:** Picture [Business Name] with a beautiful, professional website that works 24/7 to bring you customers.

Want to see what that looks like? Reply "VISUALIZE" and I'll send a custom mockup.

No cost, no obligation - just a glimpse of what's possible.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

**Psychology Used:**
- **Future pacing** - "Imagine... picture..."
- **Vivid storytelling** - Creates mental movies
- **Social proof** - Mike's specific results
- **Easy commitment** - "Just a glimpse"

## **Email 4: SOCIAL PROOF + AUTHORITY**
**Send:** Day 7 (if opened previous emails)
**Subject:** How 12 lawn care businesses in [City] fixed this problem

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

You're not alone in this challenge.

In the past 60 days, I've helped 12 lawn care businesses in [City] get professional websites. Here's what happened:

**Green Thumb Services** (your competitor on Main St):
• Before: No website, relying on word-of-mouth
• After: Website live in 24 hours
• Result: **8 new jobs in first 2 weeks**, $600+ revenue

**Perfect Cut Lawn Care:**
• Before: Basic Facebook page, hard to contact
• After: Professional site with online booking
• Result: **15% increase in bookings**, saved 5+ hours/week on phone

**Neighborhood Lawn Pros:**
• Before: Old, broken website from 2015
• After: Modern, mobile-friendly site
• Result: **Tripled online leads**, looks "10 years newer"

**The pattern is clear:** Professional websites = more jobs, less hassle.

**Here's what they all said:**
> "I wish I did this years ago."
> "So much simpler than I expected."
> "The website pays for itself every month."

**Question:** What would 3-5 extra jobs per month do for your business?

If you're ready to join them, reply "READY" and I'll show you the simple process.

If not, no worries - I'll stop following up.

## **Email 6: VALUE JUSTIFICATION + ROI**
**Send:** Day 12 (if price objection likely)
**Subject:** Why $500 is the smartest investment for your lawn care business

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Let's talk about the $500.

I know it's real money. Let me show you why it's actually a bargain:

**ROI Breakdown:**
• **Cost:** $500 one-time
• **Break-even:** Just 7 jobs at $75 each
• **Timeframe:** Most clients hit this in 2-3 weeks
• **Annual return:** $3,600+ in new revenue (based on 4 extra jobs/month)

**Put differently:**
• **Option A:** No website = lose $3,600/year
• **Option B:** $500 website = gain $3,600/year
• **Net difference:** $7,100/year

**That's a 1,420% return on investment.**

**What else could $500 buy?**
• 2 months of Facebook ads (might get clicks, might not)
• 10 lawn mower blades
• **A website that brings customers 24/7 for years**

**Our clients say:**
> "Paid for itself in 2 weeks."
> "Wish I did this sooner - leaving money on the table for years."
> "Best marketing spend ever."

**Still unsure?** Reply "CONCERN" and tell me your biggest hesitation. I'll address it directly.

Otherwise, reply "INVEST" to get started.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

**P.S.** Payment plan available: $250 now, $250 after site goes live.
